Taylor Swift started working on The Tortured Poets Department immediately after she submitted her tenth studio album, Midnights, to Republic Records for release in 2022. She continued working on it in secrecy throughout the US leg of the Eras Tour in 2023. The album's conception took place around the time the media reported that Swift's six-year relationship with the English actor Joe Alwyn had ended.

== Music and lyrics == The Tortured Poets Department  is the eleventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on April 19, 2024, through Republic Records. It was expanded into a double album two hours after its release, subtitled The Anthology, containing a second volume of songs.
Swift began writing The Tortured Poets Department shortly after finishing her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), and continued developing it during the Eras Tour in 2023. She conceived The Tortured Poets Department as an imperative songwriting project amidst her heightened fame and media scrutiny. The songs introspect on her public and private lives, detailing tumult and sorrow via motifs of self-awareness, delusion, anger, mourning, and humor. Produced with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, the album is a minimalist synth-pop, folk-pop, and chamber pop effort with rock and country stylings. The composition is largely mid-tempo, driven by a mix of synthesizers and drum machines with piano and guitar.
The album broke various sales and streaming records. It achieved the highest single-day and single-week global streams for an album on Spotify and topped the charts in territories across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas, breaking chart records in Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, The Tortured Poets Department debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week 2.6 million album-equivalent units, including 1.9 million pure sales, marking Swift's biggest sales week and record-extending seventh release to open with over a million units. Its songs made Swift the first artist to monopolize the first 14 positions of the Billboard Hot 100, with the lead single ""Fortnight"" at the top.
The album polarized mainstream critics upon release: most reviews were positive and praised Swift's cathartic songwriting for its emotional resonance and wit, but some found it overlong and lacking profundity. Subsequent assessments appreciated the album's musical and lyrical nuances that emerged upon further listens, and disputed the credibility of the initial critique for focusing on Swift's public image rather than artistic merit. Swift incorporated songs from the album in the 2024 phase of the Eras Tour that resumed in Paris, France. == Background and conception ==
Swift released her tenth studio album, Midnights, on October 21, 2022, to critical praise and commercial success. In 2023, she released two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), as part of her ""Taylor's Version"" re-recording project after a dispute over the ownership of her first six studio albums. Both re-recordings were released amidst Swift's sixth headlining concert tour, the Eras Tour, which was the first in history to surpass $1 billion in gross. At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, Swift won Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. During her acceptance speech for the former category, she announced The Tortured Poets Department as a new original studio album that she had worked on since 2022. This announcement was met with surprise from her fans, who had anticipated her to announce the re-recording of her 2017 album Reputation based on her social media clues.
Swift began conceiving the album immediately after submitting Midnights to her record label, Republic Records, and continued working on it in secret throughout the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour in 2023.

At the Eras Tour concerts in Melbourne in February 2024, Swift said that The Tortured Poets Department was a ""lifeline"" for her and an album that she ""really needed"" to make, reflecting on how it made her confirm that songwriting was an integral part of her life.

Taylor Swift started working on The Tortured Poets Department immediately after she submitted her tenth studio album, Midnights, to Republic Records for release in 2022. She continued working on it in secrecy throughout the US leg of the Eras Tour in 2023. Conceived amidst heightened fame brought by touring and publicized personal relationships, The Tortured Poets Department was a ""lifeline"" to Swift, who described it as an album she ""really needed"" to make. Republic Records released The Tortured Poets Department on April 19, 2024.
""Florida!!!"" is track eight on the album. It features vocals from Florence Welch, the frontwoman of the English band Florence and the Machine. Swift shared with iHeartRadio that the inspiration behind ""Florida!!!"" came from the series Dateline NBC. In the interview, she drew a parallel between people who flee to Florida after committing crimes and those dealing with heartbreak: ""They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in."" Welch told British Vogue that Swift approached her with ""a concept and a story"", which was her ""favourite way to start songwriting"".","The second part of the double album, subtitled The Anthology, mostly consists of chamber pop and folk-pop piano ballads. Swift and Dessner produced the majority of the second volume, which has an acoustic, folk-oriented sound instrumented by picked acoustic guitar, soft piano, and subtle synths, which critics likened to the sound of Swift's 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore."
Which artist featured on the lead single 'Fortnight' from 'The Tortured Poets Department'?,post malone,Answer the question with given context: Which artist featured on the lead single 'Fortnight' from 'The Tortured Poets Department'?,"The Tortured Poets Department  is the eleventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on April 19, 2024, through Republic Records. It was expanded into a double album two hours after its release, subtitled The Anthology, containing a second volume of songs.
Swift began writing The Tortured Poets Department shortly after finishing her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), and continued developing it during the Eras Tour in 2023. She conceived The Tortured Poets Department as an imperative songwriting project amidst her heightened fame and media scrutiny. The songs introspect on her public and private lives, detailing tumult and sorrow via motifs of self-awareness, delusion, anger, mourning, and humor. Produced with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, the album is a minimalist synth-pop, folk-pop, and chamber pop effort with rock and country stylings. The composition is largely mid-tempo, driven by a mix of synthesizers and drum machines with piano and guitar.
The album broke various sales and streaming records. It achieved the highest single-day and single-week global streams for an album on Spotify and topped the charts in territories across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas, breaking chart records in Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, The Tortured Poets Department debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week 2.6 million album-equivalent units, including 1.9 million pure sales, marking Swift's biggest sales week and record-extending seventh release to open with over a million units. Its songs made Swift the first artist to monopolize the first 14 positions of the Billboard Hot 100, with the lead single ""Fortnight"" at the top.
The album polarized mainstream critics upon release: most reviews were positive and praised Swift's cathartic songwriting for its emotional resonance and wit, but some found it overlong and lacking profundity. Subsequent assessments appreciated the album's musical and lyrical nuances that emerged upon further listens, and disputed the credibility of the initial critique for focusing on Swift's public image rather than artistic merit. Swift incorporated songs from the album in the 2024 phase of the Eras Tour that resumed in Paris, France. == Background and release ==
Swift announced The Tortured Poets Department, her eleventh original studio album, at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 5, 2024. The following day, she announced the track listing via social media; Post Malone was revealed to be the featured artist on the opening track, ""Fortnight"". She had worked on the album while on the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour in 2023. During an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1, Malone said that Swift initiated the collaboration by simply ""hitting him up"". He then ""rolled in the studio"" and hung out with her, having a ""good day"" together. At the time of the interview, Malone revealed that he had not heard the full song yet.
The track was released as the lead single of The Tortured Poets Department on April 19, 2024, concurrently with the album's release. Republic Records serviced ""Fortnight"" to contemporary hit and hot adult contemporary radio in the United States, while Universal Music promoted it on radio airplay in Italy. The track was also made available for purchase as a CD single through Swift's online store in the United States, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and Germany and Switzerland. Starting from the May 2024 shows in Nanterre as part of the Eras Tour, Swift revamped the set list to include songs from The Tortured Poets Department in a new act, including ""Fortnight"". == Background and release ==

Swift released her tenth studio album, Midnights, on October 21, 2022, to critical praise and commercial success. In 2023, she released two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), as part of her ""Taylor's Version"" re-recording project after a dispute over the ownership of her first six studio albums. Both re-recordings were released amidst Swift's sixth headlining concert tour, the Eras Tour, which was the first in history to surpass $1 billion in gross. At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, Swift won Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. During her acceptance speech for the former category, she announced The Tortured Poets Department as a new original studio album that she had worked on since 2022. This announcement was met with surprise from her fans, who had anticipated her to announce the re-recording of her 2017 album Reputation based on her social media clues.
Swift began conceiving the album immediately after submitting Midnights to her record label, Republic Records, and continued working on it in secret throughout the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour in 2023. While she was creating the album, her dating life continued to be a widely covered topic in the press, who reported on Swift in association with the actor Joe Alwyn, the singer Matty Healy, and the football player Travis Kelce. At the Eras Tour concerts in Melbourne in February 2024, Swift said that The Tortured Poets Department was a ""lifeline"" for her and an album that she ""really needed"" to make, reflecting on how it made her confirm that songwriting was an integral part of her life.

Swift signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005 and released six albums under the label. Her self-titled debut album (2006) spent more weeks on the US Billboard 200 chart than any other album in the 2000s decade, and her second studio album, Fearless (2008), was the only album from the same decade to spend one year in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. Fearless was Swift's first album to top the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Her next studio albums—Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017)—all reached number one on the Billboard 200, and each of them sold over one million US first-week copies. All four albums reached number one in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand; and the latter three all reached number one in the United Kingdom.

Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast was announced in early 2022. Principal photography occurred primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, England, and at the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.

The supporting cast includes America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.
The film premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was released to theaters in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 through Warner Bros. Pictures. Smashing box office expectations, Barbie grossed $1.44 billion worldwide with an estimated production budget of $128–145 million, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing comedy film, and the highest-grossing release by a solo female director. It is currently the fourteenth highest-grossing film of all time. Barbie received widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise towards its direction, screenplay, cast performances, cinematography, costume design, production design, and music. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 494 reviews and judged 88% to be positive.

When approached to score Oppenheimer, Göransson was initially intimidated by the scope and magnitude of the project. In the film's early stages of production, Nolan shared the script with his visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson as he needed to convey phenomena such as quantum mechanics and nuclear reactions onscreen. The visual effects team began creating experimental footage of particles, waves, and chain reactions. Nolan then showed this footage to Göransson, who used it to draw inspiration for his score.
Scoring Oppenheimer proved to be a unique challenge for Göransson as he had never composed a soundtrack that only represented one character's inner workings and point of view. He later explained, ""The movie is about [J. Robert] Oppenheimer's perspective; the audience is meant to feel what he's feeling, to see what he's seeing, to be inside of him. That’s what the music needed to do — it needed to get the audience to feel all of his feelings as you see on screen.""
Nolan did not give specific direction on how he wanted the score to sound; the only suggestion he gave Göransson was to represent Oppenheimer's character and the film's main theme with the violin. Nolan explained, ""There's a tension to the sound in a way that I think fits the highly-strung intellect and emotion of Robert Oppenheimer very well."" Using the violin as a starting point, Göransson and his wife Serena, a violinist, began experimenting with vibratos and microtonal glissandos; they aimed to convey the anxiety of Oppenheimer through the violin's ability to instantly switch from a romantic and sentimental sound to something ""neurotic"" and ""horrifying.""
For the ""Can You Hear the Music"" sequence, Nolan wanted a piece that would emulate Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he called ""one of the best pieces of music ever written."" Early in production, Nolan and Göransson attended a performance of The Rite of Spring by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. == Screenwriting credits ==

While attending UCL, Thomas completed an unpaid internship with Working Title Films and worked as a  runner and a receptionist. After earning her bachelor's degree in ancient history in 1993, she was promoted to a production coordinator for the studio. The first film that she produced was the short feature Doodlebug (1997), which depicts a man anxiously trying to kill a bug-like creature in his flat. She and Nolan created the work on 16mm film during their time at university.
After plans to create a full-length feature, Larry Mahoney, were scrapped, Thomas produced her first feature, Following (1998), with Nolan and Jeremy Theobald, who stars as an unemployed young writer who follows strangers in London in hopes of receiving material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld where he fails to keep his distance. The film was conceived on a production budget of around £3,000 (equivalent to £6,668 in 2023), and was filmed on weekends over the course of a year; with scenes being rehearsed extensively to preserve film stock. Following was positively received by film critics and won several awards at various film festivals.
Thomas pitched Nolan's screenplay for their breakthrough film Memento (2000), which follows a man with anterograde amnesia who uses photographs, notes, and tattoos to hunt his wife's murderer, to Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films, who lauded the script. The film was given a budget of $4.5 million (equivalent to $8,000,000 in 2023) and was distributed by Newmarket to 500 theatres in the United States after it was rejected by other studios, who feared that it would not attract a wide audience. Thomas was credited as an associate producer of Memento, which received critical acclaim and several accolades, including two nominations at the 74th Academy Awards. Six critics listed it as one of the best films of the 2000s.

Zanobard Reviews wrote ""Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt’s brightly exuberant score for Barbie serves as not only an excellent companion piece to the song album, but also a fun, energetic and indeed very enjoyable piece of musical work all on its own."" Music critic Jonathan Broxton also said, ""The way the two musical sides of this film – the original songs, and the original score – co-operate is very impressive to me, and shows me that [Greta] Gerwig, [Mark] Ronson, [Andrew] Wyatt, and the others thought a great deal about the musical content of their film, what they wanted it to say and do. And really, that’s pretty much all you can ask for."" In a mixed review, critic based at Filmtracks.com commented ""The score's only average appeal was likely a result sealed during the spotting stage of production, with the Eilish song's outsized influence a poor choice given its lack of warmth for any of those adaptations. The songs are also a very hit-and-miss prospect. The whole soundtrack requires a combined, chronological song and score presentation to best appreciate. The release of the two halves on separate albums defies the fact that all the music for Barbie is too synergistic for such a release.""

Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and introduced on March 9, 1959. The toy was based on the German Bild Lilli doll which Handler had purchased while in Europe. The figurehead of an eponymous brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories, Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company's largest and most profitable line. The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since 1984, including video games, animated films, television/web series, and a live-action film.
Barbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world. Mattel generates a large portion of Barbie revenue though related merchandise — accessories, clothes, friends, and relatives of Barbie. Writing for Journal of Popular Culture in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with affluent friends. == Accolades ==

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses. Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Ben Kingsley, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt, Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Eddie Redmayne, and Cillian Murphy all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics: Beatty and Dunaway as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi (1982), Depp as Ed Wood in Ed Wood (1994), Carrey as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999), Downey as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin (1992) and as Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer (2023), Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray (2004), Thompson and Hanks as P. L. Travers and Walt Disney in Saving Mr. Banks (2013), Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (2014), and Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer in Oppenheimer (2023).
 Some biopics purposely stretch the truth.

How did the film address the idea of personal identity and self-worth?,the film addressed personal identity and self-worth by showing barbie's journey of self-discovery and confronting societal expectations.,Answer the question with given context: How did the film address the idea of personal identity and self-worth?,"A biographical film or biopic () is a film that dramatizes the life of an actual person or group of people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used. They differ from docudrama films and historical drama films in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.


== Context == Biopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. Custen, in Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History (1992), regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era, and in particular, Darryl F. Zanuck. On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study, Film/Genre. Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's Bio-Pics: a life in pictures (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list. Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, ""Taking Hollywood Back"" in the 2009 issue of Cinema Journal.
Roger Ebert defended The Hurricane and distortions in biographical films in general, stating ""those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... The Hurricane is not a documentary but a parable."" == Film representations ==
Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses. Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Ben Kingsley, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt, Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Eddie Redmayne, and Cillian Murphy all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics: Beatty and Dunaway as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi (1982), Depp as Ed Wood in Ed Wood (1994), Carrey as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999), Downey as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin (1992) and as Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer (2023), Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray (2004), Thompson and Hanks as P. L. Travers and Walt Disney in Saving Mr. Banks (2013), Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (2014), and Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer in Oppenheimer (2023).
 Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was based on game show host Chuck Barris' widely debunked yet popular memoir of the same name, in which he claimed to be a CIA agent. Kafka incorporated both the life of author Franz Kafka and the surreal aspects of his fiction. The Errol Flynn film They Died with",Barbie's journey involves finding her own identity and confronting societal expectations. The film emphasizes the importance of self-worth and the idea that 'just being yourself is enough.'
What role did nostalgia play in the audience's reception of the film?,nostalgia played a significant role by drawing on the audience's fond memories of barbie while also challenging their perceptions.,The track listing for Past Lives is as follows:,"== Reception ==
Zanobard Reviews wrote ""Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt’s brightly exuberant score for Barbie serves as not only an excellent companion piece to the song album, but also a fun, energetic and indeed very enjoyable piece of musical work all on its own."" Music critic Jonathan Broxton also said, ""The way the two musical sides of this film – the original songs, and the original score – co-operate is very impressive to me, and shows me that [Greta] Gerwig, [Mark] Ronson, [Andrew] Wyatt, and the others thought a great deal about the musical content of their film, what they wanted it to say and do. And really, that’s pretty much all you can ask for."" In a mixed review, critic based at Filmtracks.com commented ""The score's only average appeal was likely a result sealed during the spotting stage of production, with the Eilish song's outsized influence a poor choice given its lack of warmth for any of those adaptations. The songs are also a very hit-and-miss prospect. The whole soundtrack requires a combined, chronological song and score presentation to best appreciate. The release of the two halves on separate albums defies the fact that all the music for Barbie is too synergistic for such a release."" Past Lives is a 2023 American romantic drama film written and directed by Celine Song in her feature directorial debut. Starring Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro, it follows two childhood friends over the course of 24 years while they contemplate the nature of their relationship as they grow apart, living different lives. The plot is semi-autobiographical and inspired by real events from Song's life.
Past Lives premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2023, and was released theatrically in the United States on June 2, 2023. The film received critical acclaim and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute and received various accolades including five nominations at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (for Lee). At the 96th Academy Awards, it received nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. Ronson and Wyatt referenced the works of John Williams, Nino Rota and Carter Burwell, as well as Elmer Bernstein's score for Ghostbusters (1984) and contemporary music from the 1970s and 1980s such as those of the films Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Working Girl (1988). They further cited Maurice Jarre and Thomas Newman and the balance of synthesizers and orchestra in the ""really lovely way"". Ronson used the Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer from his studio, that produces a kind of ""eerie and windy, but rich and emotive"" referencing the sound of the television series Stranger Things. Gerwig enjoyed orchestral and classical music, which led to Ronson and Wyatt tasked with balancing two different sounds.

As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.
Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.
Among its many accolades, Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Nolan, Best Actor for Murphy and Best Supporting Actor for Downey.

=== Critical response ===
John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote that J. Robert Oppenheimer was ""persuasively"" played by Sam Waterston and the series ""is primarily interested in telling, quite absorbingly, one of the more puzzling and indeed astonishing stories of contemporary American history"". Bill Carter of The Baltimore Sun called it ""never less than a fascinating portrait of a truly fascinating man"" while criticizing a ""choppy production technique that makes much of the film seem rather raw"".
Major General Kenneth Nichols disputed his portrayal in the series, saying that it ""portrayed me serving as a personal aide to Groves on frequent visits to Los Alamos"", when he did so only once.

While a professor at Berkeley, Oppenheimer began an intense relationship with graduate student Jean Tatlock, which instilled a new interest in social and political activism. Amidst the Great Depression, Oppenheimer developed an appeal for the unemployed and migrant farmers and later gave donations for Spanish relief through the Communist Party of America (CPUSA) and funded refugees from Nazi Germany. At Berkeley, Oppenheimer held union meetings at his home and maintained an inner circle of students who became associated with left-wing activities. Oppenheimer's brother Frank joined the Communist Party to Robert's disapproval. 
Despite Oppenheimer's activism, the book points out that his exact relationship with the communist party remains unclear. Reports of friends and associates such as Haakon Chevalier and FBI recordings could merely portray him as a fellow traveler. Never formally having a card and later denying he ever had a membership, Oppenheimer described his interaction with the party as ""very brief and very intense.""

Barbie, the fashion doll created by Ruth Handler, was introduced in 1959 and quickly became a popular toy among children. Mattel, the company that manufactures Barbie, used various marketing tactics to promote the doll, including television advertisements, print media, and partnerships with other companies.","Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and introduced on March 9, 1959. The toy was based on the German Bild Lilli doll which Handler had purchased while in Europe. The figurehead of an eponymous brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories, Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company's largest and most profitable line. The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since 1984, including video games, animated films, television/web series, and a live-action film.
Barbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world. Mattel generates a large portion of Barbie revenue though related merchandise — accessories, clothes, friends, and relatives of Barbie. Writing for Journal of Popular Culture in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with affluent friends. == Origins ==
Barbie debuted on March 9, 1959, at the American International Toy Fair (now the North American International Toy Fair) and it was well received locally in the United States, sparking a revolution in the toy industry. Since then, numerous likenesses of the doll were released which later evolved into what is now considered as ""Barbie's friends and family"" and clothing and accessories to accompany them. Various print hardcover and comic books starring Barbie were also released through partnerships and/or deals with Dell Comics, Marvel Comics and currently Papercutz.
In the 1980s, the net popularity and sales of the Barbie fashion doll on the toy market began to decline and struggled further in 2001 when MGA Entertainment introduced a line of dolls under the name Bratz, whose sexualized characters contrasted with Barbie's older, chaste image. Mattel therefore attempted to overhaul the Barbie brand to keep the toy relevant to consumers in the modern age by bringing in consultants and conducting research on key market groups. Mattel consultants initially considered reducing the Barbie's breast size, but later claimed that the doll's figure could not be changed because ""being consistent is one of her biggest strengths"". Mattel's team also considered targeting market audiences of career women and their daughters by introducing lines of Doctor or Lawyer Barbies. However, Mattel's research showed that girls were spending more time online than playing with physical dolls. Therefore, targeted career Barbies were discarded in favor of looking for more interactive platforms through online or digital media.
In response, Mattel began adapting Barbie into various facets of media and entertainment beyond the television advertisement of its dolls and related accessories (which was a prolific marketing strategy in the past). For the first 16 entries in the film series, Barbie is featured as a virtual actress playing the main character, and often being portrayed as a modern girl telling the story to one of her sisters or a younger friend – as a parable to present affairs. Scholars examining how the Barbie films differ from other princess narratives have concluded that Mattel intentionally attempted to == Accolades ==

Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer into a non-observant Jewish family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer. Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist. Their father was born in Hanau, when it was still part of the Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and as a teenager made his way to the United States in 1888, without money, higher education, or even English. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy. In 1912, the family moved to an apartment on Riverside Drive near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their art collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and Vincent van Gogh.
Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School. In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society School, founded by Felix Adler to promote training based on the Ethical Cult","The Barbie film's narrative begins with Barbie living in a utopia and eventually experiencing reality, where she confronts societal expectations. Oppenheimer alternated between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, exploring complex themes of guilt and responsibility."
"What were the critical responses to the portrayal of historical accuracy in Oppenheimer, and how did it impact the film's reception?","critics praised the historical accuracy of oppenheimer, which enhanced the film's credibility and reception.","The critical response to Oppenheimer has been overwhelmingly positive, with many praising the film for its compelling portrayal of J.

Oppenheimer at IMDb Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller drama film written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.
Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.
Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.
Among its many accolades, Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Nolan, Best Actor for Murphy and Best Supporting Actor for Downey. It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.","The production team conducted extensive research to ensure historical accuracy, including using IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film. Critics noted the film's nuanced portrayal of historical events and its commitment to accuracy, which positively impacted its reception."

Keely Weiss of Elle Magazine writes: ""...showrunner Meaghan Oppenheimer pulled [the adaptation] off with aplomb, turning Lovering's novel into a visually propulsive show populated by a rich cast of characters, all while preserving the core themes of the book.

Zanobard Reviews wrote ""Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt’s brightly exuberant score for Barbie serves as not only an excellent companion piece to the song album, but also a fun, energetic and indeed very enjoyable piece of musical work all on its own."" Music critic Jonathan Broxton also said, ""The way the two musical sides of this film – the original songs, and the original score – co-operate is very impressive to me, and shows me that [Greta] Gerwig, [Mark] Ronson, [Andrew] Wyatt, and the others thought a great deal about the musical content of their film, what they wanted it to say and do. And really, that’s pretty much all you can ask for."" In a mixed review, critic based at Filmtracks.com commented ""The score's only average appeal was likely a result sealed during the spotting stage of production, with the Eilish song's outsized influence a poor choice given its lack of warmth for any of those adaptations. The songs are also a very hit-and-miss prospect. The whole soundtrack requires a combined, chronological song and score presentation to best appreciate. The release of the two halves on separate albums defies the fact that all the music for Barbie is too synergistic for such a release."" == Reception ==
Jennifer Green of Common Sense Media gave the film a positive review, saying ""it's hard not to admit that these animated adventures offer upbeat fun."" Screen Rant noted that the film bore many similarities to The Princess Switch film series.

While a professor at Berkeley, Oppenheimer began an intense relationship with graduate student Jean Tatlock, which instilled a new interest in social and political activism. Amidst the Great Depression, Oppenheimer developed an appeal for the unemployed and migrant farmers and later gave donations for Spanish relief through the Communist Party of America (CPUSA) and funded refugees from Nazi Germany. At Berkeley, Oppenheimer held union meetings at his home and maintained an inner circle of students who became associated with left-wing activities. Oppenheimer's brother Frank joined the Communist Party to Robert's disapproval. 
Despite Oppenheimer's activism, the book points out that his exact relationship with the communist party remains unclear. Reports of friends and associates such as Haakon Chevalier and FBI recordings could merely portray him as a fellow traveler. Never formally having a card and later denying he ever had a membership, Oppenheimer described his interaction with the party as ""very brief and very intense.""

Based on the eponymous fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous animated films and specials. It stars Margot Robbie as the title character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, and follows them on a journey of self-discovery through both Barbieland and the real world following an existential crisis. It is also a commentary regarding patriarchy and the effects of feminism. The supporting cast includes America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.
A live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast was announced in early 2022. Principal photography occurred primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, England, and at the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.","Gerwig's casting choices included diverse actors to reflect a more inclusive and empowering image of Barbie.

Barbie debuted on March 9, 1959, at the American International Toy Fair (now the North American International Toy Fair) and it was well received locally in the United States, sparking a revolution in the toy industry. Since then, numerous likenesses of the doll were released which later evolved into what is now considered as ""Barbie's friends and family"" and clothing and accessories to accompany them. Various print hardcover and comic books starring Barbie were also released through partnerships and/or deals with Dell Comics, Marvel Comics and currently Papercutz.
In the 1980s, the net popularity and sales of the Barbie fashion doll on the toy market began to decline and struggled further in 2001 when MGA Entertainment introduced a line of dolls under the name Bratz, whose sexualized characters contrasted with Barbie's older, chaste image. Mattel therefore attempted to overhaul the Barbie brand to keep the toy relevant to consumers in the modern age by bringing in consultants and conducting research on key market groups. Mattel consultants initially considered reducing the Barbie's breast size, but later claimed that the doll's figure could not be changed because ""being consistent is one of her biggest strengths"". Mattel's team also considered targeting market audiences of career women and their daughters by introducing lines of Doctor or Lawyer Barbies.

Therefore, targeted career Barbies were discarded in favor of looking for more interactive platforms through online or digital media.

For the first 16 entries in the film series, Barbie is featured as a virtual actress playing the main character, and often being portrayed as a modern girl telling the story to one of her sisters or a younger friend – as a parable to present affairs.

Barbie (Score from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the score album to the 2023 film Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig from a screenplay she wrote with Noah Baumbach, and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Originally, Alexandre Desplat was recruited to score the film's music in September 2022, but following his exit, Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, who executive produced the soundtrack and contributed to the production and composition of the original songs, worked on the film's score in March 2023. WaterTower Music released the album on August 4, 2023, digitally, with CD and vinyl formats released later.
The score was nominated several awards including the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for Visual Media.","Gerwig's personal experiences with Barbie included both fond memories and the complex societal pressures on American teenage girls. These personal experiences, along with broader societal influences, shaped the film's narrative to address themes of feminism, beauty standards, and social expectations."

Zanobard Reviews wrote ""Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt’s brightly exuberant score for Barbie serves as not only an excellent companion piece to the song album, but also a fun, energetic and indeed very enjoyable piece of musical work all on its own."" Music critic Jonathan Broxton also said, ""The way the two musical sides of this film – the original songs, and the original score – co-operate is very impressive to me, and shows me that [Greta] Gerwig, [Mark] Ronson, [Andrew] Wyatt, and the others thought a great deal about the musical content of their film, what they wanted it to say and do. And really, that’s pretty much all you can ask for."" In a mixed review, critic based at Filmtracks.com commented ""The score's only average appeal was likely a result sealed during the spotting stage of production, with the Eilish song's outsized influence a poor choice given its lack of warmth for any of those adaptations. The songs are also a very hit-and-miss prospect. The whole soundtrack requires a combined, chronological song and score presentation to best appreciate. The release of the two halves on separate albums defies the fact that all the music for Barbie is too synergistic for such a release."" == Music and lyrics ==

There are 16 songs on the soundtrack, and the third is named ""Barbie World"". It samples Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"", looping the chorus's vocals from the band's lead singer, Lene Nystrøm. Making the song began with figuring out how to integrate the sample, so Ronson turned to producer RiotUSA to create a beat around it, though the plan was not in the script the film's director, Greta Gerwig, had. Initially, in 2022, Nystrøm's manager stated ""Barbie Girl"" would not be used on the film, to an indignant reaction from fans. Variety speculated bad relations between Mattel and MCA Records were the cause. Nevertheless, the team behind the soundtrack, including Robbie, were passionate for it to be included in some way. They were faced with a dilemma: whether to include ""Barbie Girl"" on the soundtrack directly, or to instead reimagine it. When asked why they chose the second, Ronson said: ""I don't know, you'd have to ask Greta. But everythi == Official description ==

Gerwig described the ending as a 'mic drop kind of joke,' instilling confidence in younger girls."
What role did societal pressures play in the development of Barbie's narrative and themes?,"societal pressures influenced the narrative to address themes of feminism, beauty standards, and challenges faced by women.","Barbie has been a popular fashion doll for over six decades, and her impact on society has been significant. She has been described as the two most popular dolls in the world, and Mattel generates a large portion of Barbie revenue through related merchandise.

Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.
Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros.

Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May.

Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.

When approached to score Oppenheimer, Göransson was initially intimidated by the scope and magnitude of the project. In the film's early stages of production, Nolan shared the script with his visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson as he needed to convey phenomena such as quantum mechanics and nuclear reactions onscreen. The visual effects team began creating experimental footage of particles, waves, and chain reactions. Nolan then showed this footage to Göransson, who used it to draw inspiration for his score.
Scoring Oppenheimer proved to be a unique challenge for Göransson as he had never composed a soundtrack that only represented one character's inner workings and point of view. He later explained, ""The movie is about [J. Robert] Oppenheimer's perspective; the audience is meant to feel what he's feeling, to see what he's seeing, to be inside of him. That’s what the music needed to do — it needed to get the audience to feel all of his feelings as you see on screen.""
Nolan did not give specific direction on how he wanted the score to sound; the only suggestion he gave Göransson was to represent Oppenheimer's character and the film's main theme with the violin. Nolan explained, ""There's a tension to the sound in a way that I think fits the highly-strung intellect and emotion of Robert Oppenheimer very well."" Using the violin as a starting point, Göransson and his wife Serena, a violinist, began experimenting with vibratos and microtonal glissandos; they aimed to convey the anxiety of Oppenheimer through the violin's ability to instantly switch from a romantic and sentimental sound to something ""neurotic"" and ""horrifying.""
For the ""Can You Hear the Music"" sequence, Nolan wanted a piece that would emulate Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he called ""one of the best pieces of music ever written."" Early in production, Nolan and Göransson attended a performance of The Rite of Spring by the Los Angeles Philharmonic.","Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.

The film grossed $1.446 billion and achieved several milestones, including the highest-grossing film of 2023 and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time. Named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, it received critical acclaim and other accolades, including eight Academy Award nominations (among them Best Picture), winning Best Original Song for ""What Was I Made For?""; the song also won Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song while Barbie was awarded Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.","Oppenheimer grossed over $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023.

How did Nolan's personal experiences and historical events influence his approach to the Oppenheimer screenplay?,nolan was influenced by his fears of nuclear holocaust and the resurgence of nuclear anxiety during the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine.,1. What is the main topic of the paragraph?,"=== Development ===
When approached to score Oppenheimer, Göransson was initially intimidated by the scope and magnitude of the project. In the film's early stages of production, Nolan shared the script with his visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson as he needed to convey phenomena such as quantum mechanics and nuclear reactions onscreen. The visual effects team began creating experimental footage of particles, waves, and chain reactions. Nolan then showed this footage to Göransson, who used it to draw inspiration for his score.
Scoring Oppenheimer proved to be a unique challenge for Göransson as he had never composed a soundtrack that only represented one character's inner workings and point of view. He later explained, ""The movie is about [J. Robert] Oppenheimer's perspective; the audience is meant to feel what he's feeling, to see what he's seeing, to be inside of him. That’s what the music needed to do — it needed to get the audience to feel all of his feelings as you see on screen.""
Nolan did not give specific direction on how he wanted the score to sound; the only suggestion he gave Göransson was to represent Oppenheimer's character and the film's main theme with the violin. Nolan explained, ""There's a tension to the sound in a way that I think fits the highly-strung intellect and emotion of Robert Oppenheimer very well."" Using the violin as a starting point, Göransson and his wife Serena, a violinist, began experimenting with vibratos and microtonal glissandos; they aimed to convey the anxiety of Oppenheimer through the violin's ability to instantly switch from a romantic and sentimental sound to something ""neurotic"" and ""horrifying.""
For the ""Can You Hear the Music"" sequence, Nolan wanted a piece that would emulate Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he called ""one of the best pieces of music ever written."" Early in production, Nolan and Göransson attended a performance of The Rite of Spring by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller drama film written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.
Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.
Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.
Among its many accolades, Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Nolan, Best Actor for Murphy and Best Supporting Actor for Downey. It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute. == Reception ==


=== Critical response ===
John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote that J. Robert Oppenheimer was ""persuasively"" played by Sam Waterston and the series ""is primarily interested in telling, quite absorbingly, one of the more puzzling and indeed astonishing stories of contemporary American history"". Bill Carter of The Baltimore Sun called it ""never less than a fascinating portrait of a truly fascinating man"" while criticizing a ""choppy production technique that makes much of the film seem rather raw"".
Major General Kenneth Nichols disputed his portrayal in the series, saying that it ""portrayed me serving as a personal aide to Groves on frequent visits to Los Alamos"", when he did so only once.
